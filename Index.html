        <h2>Significant Impact on WWII</h2>
        <p>On June 6, 1944, the Allies launched a major invasion of Normandy, France. Troops from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other Allied nations fought against strong German defenses. D-Day marked the start of the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control. It was a turning point that led to the fall of Hitler and victory for the Allies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Largest Amphibious Invasion</h2>
        <p>D-Day was the biggest amphibious invasion in history. Over 5,000 ships and landing craft carried more than 150,000 soldiers to the beaches of Normandy.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Five Main Beaches</h2>
        <p>The Allied forces landed on five beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword, covering about 50 miles of coastline.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Weather Delays</h2>
        <p>The invasion was supposed to happen on June 5 but got delayed by one day because of bad weather. A short break in the storm allowed them to launch on June 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Air and Naval Support</h2>
        <p>More than 11,000 airplanes helped with bombing and protection, while about 7,000 ships supported the beach landings during Operation Neptune, the naval part of the invasion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Airborne Troopers' Role</h2>
        <p>Over 18,000 paratroopers and glider soldiers were dropped behind German lines right after midnight to capture important roads and bridges before the beach landings started.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Heavy Fighting at Omaha Beach</h2>
        <p>Omaha Beach saw the worst fighting, with over 2,000 American soldiers killed or wounded because of tough German defenses and rough terrain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Breaking the Enigma Code</h2>
        <p>The Allies were able to crack Germany's secret Enigma code, which helped them predict German troop movements and plan D-Day more successfully.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Deception Plans</h2>
        <p>The Allies tricked Germany with fake armies and false radio messages through operations like Operation Bodyguard and Fortitude. This confused the Germans about where the real invasion would happen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Help from the French Resistance</h2>
        <p>The French Resistance, along with British special forces, sabotaged German railroads, bridges, and communications to help the invasion succeed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Specialized Equipment</h2>
        <p>The Allies used modified tanks called "Hobart's Funnies" to clear mines, destroy bunkers, and help troops cross obstacles on the beaches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Beach Defenses</h2>
        <p>The Germans set up obstacles like wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and barbed wire along the beaches to slow down the Allied attack and stop tanks from advancing.</p>
    </div>
